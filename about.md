# Auto Screenshot

Auto screenshot after level complete or new best

In the settings, you can set default values for when screenshots will be taken, as well as set a delay before creating a screenshot (this setting applies to all levels). Additional settings can be configured separately for each level in the pause menu by clicking the screenshot button icon
